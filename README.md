# Creative Canvas a raster graphics editor

The Creative Canvas Android application is a feature-rich tool designed for drawing, sketching, and image editing directly on Android devices. With its diverse set of tools and functionalities, it offers users the ability to express their creativity, annotate images, and utilize it as a raster graphics editor.<br>
The Creative Canvas application offers a diverse selection of drawing tools, encompassing brushes of different sizes, shapes, and textures. Users have the freedom to select from a wide-ranging color palette or generate custom colors, enabling them to unleash their imagination.
One of the standout features of the application is its ability to draw over images. Users can import an existing image or capture a new one using the device's camera. Once loaded, the image can be placed as a background layer on the canvas, serving as a reference or starting point. Users can then use the drawing tools to add annotations, highlights, or other graphic elements on top of the image. This feature proves particularly useful for annotating screenshots, creating memes, or enhancing photographs with hand-drawn effects.
